# Additional places icons for Breeze

Breeze only ships a certain number of icons for folders and other places.

This repository contains more icons, including ones of very specific projects, so your filemanager will be filled with organization and cleanliness. All contributions are welcome! Just send your icons to me, or open a Pull Request.

License: GNU LGPL, just like Breeze (see `LICENSE` for more details)

## Installing 

If you have the needed dependencies, installing the icons is very easy. Assuming your Breeze installation lives under `/usr` (true for most distributions):

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. && sudo make install`
